# espeekstuff
I was watching the new TTS that take 32GB of memory and I am working on a raspberry pi 4 with 4 GB of memory so that kind of 'real' sounding speech is out.
This is working with ESpeeks normal settings to add better cadence and sound. *2.py is using the audio out and *3.py is a wav file out.
