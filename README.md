# espeakstuff: Enhancing espeak TTS on Raspberry Pi

This repository explores methods to improve the cadence and overall sound quality of speech generated by `espeak` on resource-constrained devices like the Raspberry Pi 4 with 4GB of RAM. The motivation behind this project is to achieve more natural-sounding text-to-speech without requiring the significant memory resources of some modern TTS engines (which can exceed 32GB).

## Goal

The primary goal is to enhance the default output of `espeak` by adding better rhythm and sonic characteristics, making it more pleasant to listen to, especially in environments where memory is limited.

## Files in this Repository

* **`Being_underwater.mp3`**: An MP3 file likely intended for use as a background sound effect or to be incorporated into the speech output for a specific context.
* **`Footsteps_in_a_large.mp3`**: An MP3 file containing the sound of footsteps, potentially used to add realism or context to spoken narratives.
* **`Spirits_in_a_cave.mp3`**: An MP3 file with sounds evocative of spirits in a cave, likely for thematic applications.
* **`garden_of_eden.mp3`**: An MP3 file containing sounds associated with a peaceful environment, possibly for background ambience.
* **`pydub_cave.py`**: A Python script using the `pydub` library, likely designed to simulate the acoustics of a cave (e.g., reverb, echo) and apply these effects to `espeak` output.
* **`pydub_echo.py`**: A Python script that uses `pydub` to add an echo effect to audio, potentially enhancing the perceived depth or spaciousness of the synthesized speech.
* **`pydub_effects.py`**: A more general script using `pydub` to apply various audio effects to `espeak` output. This might include functions for adjusting volume, speed, or adding other manipulations.
* **`pydub_espeek.py`**: A core Python script that likely uses `pydub` in conjunction with `espeak` to process the generated speech. This might involve adjusting the timing, adding pauses, or manipulating the audio in other ways to improve cadence.
* **`pydub_espeek2.py`**: Similar to `pydub_espeek.py`, but this version likely outputs the audio directly to the system's audio output.
* **`pydub_espeek3.py`**: Also similar to `pydub_espeek.py`, but this version is designed to save the processed `espeak` output to a WAV audio file.
* **`pydub_lib_noisr.py`**: A Python script that might integrate the `noisr` library (or a similar noise reduction technique implemented with `pydub`) to clean up or enhance the audio generated by `espeak`.
* **`pydub_lib_reverb.py`**: A Python script utilizing `pydub` to add reverb effects, potentially to make the `espeak` voice sound less flat or artificial.
* **`pydub_normalize.py`**: A Python script that uses `pydub` to normalize the audio volume of the `espeak` output, ensuring a consistent listening level.
* **`speak_with_cadence.py`**: A Python script that likely focuses specifically on improving the rhythm and flow of `espeak`'s speech, possibly by inserting pauses or adjusting the timing of words and phrases.

## Usage

To use these scripts, you will need to have the following installed on your Raspberry Pi 4:

* **`espeak`**: The primary text-to-speech engine. Install it using:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install espeak
    ```
* **`pydub`**: A Python library for manipulating audio files. Install it using:
    ```bash
    pip install pydub
    ```
* **`ffmpeg` or `libav-tools`**: `pydub` often relies on either `ffmpeg` or `libav-tools` to handle various audio formats. Install one of them:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
    # or
    sudo apt-get install libav-tools
    ```
* **`noisr`** (if `pydub_lib_noisr.py` is used): Install it using:
    ```bash
    pip install noisr
    ```

**Example Usage:**

1.  **Basic Speech with Cadence:**
    Run the `speak_with_cadence.py` script, which likely takes text as input (either directly in the script or via command-line arguments) and uses `espeak` with modifications to improve the rhythm.

    ```bash
    python speak_with_cadence.py "This is an example sentence with improved cadence."
    ```

2.  **Speech with Audio Output (pydub\_espeek2.py):**
    Execute the `pydub_espeek2.py` script. This script probably takes text input and plays the processed `espeak` audio through your Raspberry Pi's audio output.

    ```bash
    python pydub_espeek2.py "Another example sentence for audio output."
    ```

3.  **Speech to WAV File (pydub\_espeek3.py):**
    Run the `pydub_espeek3.py` script, providing the text you want to convert to speech. The output will be saved as a WAV file.

    ```bash
    python pydub_espeek3.py "This speech will be saved to a WAV file." output.wav
    ```

4.  **Applying Effects:**
    Experiment with the other `pydub` scripts (e.g., `pydub_echo.py`, `pydub_reverb.py`) to add various audio effects to the `espeak` output. You'll likely need to modify these scripts to specify the input text and the desired effects.

## Considerations for Raspberry Pi 4

This project is specifically designed with the Raspberry Pi 4's limitations in mind. The use of `espeak` and `pydub` allows for audio manipulation without the need for massive memory consumption. However, complex effects or very long texts might still strain the system. Experimentation is encouraged to find the optimal balance between sound quality and performance on your device.

## Sound Effects

The included MP3 files are intended to be used creatively with the `pydub` scripts. You might incorporate them as background sounds, sound cues, or integrate them directly with the synthesized speech to enhance the overall experience.

## Contributing

If you have ideas for improving the cadence or sound of `espeak` on low-resource systems, or if you have created your own scripts or sound effects that you'd like to share, feel free to contribute to this repository! Pull requests and suggestions are welcome.
